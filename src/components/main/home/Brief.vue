		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			I am a Computer &amp; Software Enginner graduate from <a href="https://www.usj.edu.lb/anglais" target="_blank">Saint-Joseph University of Beirut</a>,
			where I am currently completing my Masters in Artificial Intelligence.
			<br/>
			There, I presided over their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/USJAstronomyClub" target="_blank">Astronomy Club</a>,
			which I have been very active in for 5 years.
		</p><p>
			I have always been passionate about science and technology, especially astronomy and game development.
			<br/>
			I then found my passion for web development, especially front-end, and built my first personal website at the age of 15.
		</p><p>
			I am currently working as a Web Developer &amp; Data Integration Analyst at <a href="https://dcgroup.com" target="_blank">Data Consult</a>.
			<br/>
			I am also regularly being requested to organize or give astronomy talks and sessions.
